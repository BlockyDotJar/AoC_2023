# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) Solutions in Java

This repository contains solutions to [Eric Wastls](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) Advent of Code 2023.
<br>**Thank you, Eric!**

While the code aims to be as fast as possible (the goal is to complete all puzzles of 2023 in under one second),
I often lack the time and/or knowledge to optimize it properly.

<hr>

**Note:** This code isn't a masterpiece, and I am not a Java Pro, so don't expect that this is the best Java code,
you have ever seen and there probably won't be all 25 day solutions.

Like I said, this is not the *best* or maybe not even a *good* solution.
